## Build Process

Due to this being my first attempt at building both a front-end client and back-end api.The goal was to keep the application as simple as possible. Although after meeting the requirements early on, I wanted to implent a handful of css styling. My plan for version one was to make my application pleasing to eyes of a user.

## Unsolved Problems

Still to be addressed - making the application responsive for all types of users. I also have to work on creating a table with html and implementing javascript in order for the user to view their sneakers in a more pleasant way.
